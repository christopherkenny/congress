`congress` provides a *mostly* tidy interface to the Congress.gov API, available at <https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/>.
It provides a simple R interface for downloading and working with actions, bills, nominations, and more from Congress.

## Installation

You can install the stable version of `congress` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=congress) with:

``` r
install.packages('congress')
```

You can install the development version of congress from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('christopherkenny/congress')
```

## Example

To get the most recent `nomination`s, we can use the `cong_nomination()` function. By default, it gets the most recent 20. We request here, the most recent 10.

```{r example}
library(congress)

cong_nomination(limit = 10)
```

You can request up to 250 results, using `limit`. Once a request has been made, you can request the next set by using the `offset` argument:

```{r}
cong_nomination(limit = 10, offset = 10)
```

You can also request the next set using the `cong_request_next()` function:

```{r}
cong_nomination(limit = 10) |>
  cong_request_next()
```



## Supported Endpoints:

This package is designed for `v3` of the [Congress.gov API](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/). It currently supports the following endpoints:

- bills with `cong_bill()`
- amendments with `cong_amendment()`
- summaries with `cong_summaries()`
- congresses with `cong_congress()`
- members with `cong_member()`
- committees with `cong_committee()`
- committee reports with `cong_committee_report()`
- committee prints with `cong_committee_print()`
- committee meetings with `cong_committee_meeting()`
- Congressional Records with `cong_record()`
- Daily Congressional Records with `cong_daily_record()`
- Bound Congressional Records with `cong_bound_record()`
- House communications with `cong_house_communication()`
- Senate communications with `cong_senate_communication()`
- nominations with `cong_nomination()`
- treaties with `cong_treaty()`
- hearings with `cong_hearing()`

## Authentication

To sign up for an API key, visit the [Congress.gov API](https://api.congress.gov/sign-up/) sign-up website. 

Once you have your key, you can set it in your environment as `CONGRESS_KEY`.
You can:

1. Add this directly to your `.Renviron` file with a line like so

```r
CONGRESS_KEY='yourkey'
```

If doing this, I recommend using `usethis::edit_r_environ()` to ensure that you open the correct .Renviron file.

2. Set this in you current R session with `Sys.setenv(CONGRESS_KEY='yourkey')`.

3. Set this using the `congress::set_congress_key()` function. To save this for future sessions, run with `install = TRUE`.
