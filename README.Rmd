`congress` provides a *mostly* tidy interface to the Congress.gov API, available at <https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/>.
It provides a simple R interface for downloading and working with actions, bills, nominations, and more from Congress.

## Installation

You can install the stable version of `congress` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=congress) with:

``` r
install.packages('congress')
```

You can install the development version of congress from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('christopherkenny/congress')
```

## Example

To get the most recent `nomination`s, we can use the `cong_nomination()` function. By default, it gets the most recent 20. We request here, the most recent 10.

```{r example}
library(congress)

cong_nomination(limit = 10)
```
